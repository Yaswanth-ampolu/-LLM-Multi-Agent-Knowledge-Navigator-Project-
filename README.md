# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Intelligent Agent Hub
### repository contains a Streamlit application that integrates various AI-powered tools to assist with coding, mathematical calculations, real-time information retrieval, and research. It leverages the capabilities of LangChain agents, Groq's LLM (Large Language Model), and several APIs to provide a versatile and dynamic querying environment.

## üåü Features
## Agent 1:
### Tools: Python REPL, Shell commands.
### Use Case: Ideal for performing mathematical calculations, running Python code, and executing shell commands.
## Agent 2:
### Tools: DuckDuckGo, Google Search, YouTube Search.
### Use Case: Suitable for retrieving real-time information from the web, including searching for videos on YouTube.
## Agent 3:
### Tools: DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, ArXiv, PubMed, Google Search.
### Use Case: Perfect for research purposes, providing access to scientific literature and encyclopedic knowledge.
## Manager Agent:
### Manages the three agents above to provide a comprehensive response depending on the query type.
## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository
